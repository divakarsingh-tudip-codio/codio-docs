<h3 id="updating-courses-and-collaboration">Updating courses and collaboration<a class="headerlink" href="#updating-courses-and-collaboration" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>If you want to allow other teachers in your organization to modify your course structure and unit content then it is important to understand how Codio manages this. Please refer to <a href="/courses/units/course-collaborate/">Collaborating on project units</a> for details.</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>The most basic way to assign content to students is to create a project and then <a href="/classes/unitmanagement/assign-project">assign the project to the class</a>. Over time, you may end up with a lot of projects in your project list. Each time you come to teach your course, you will find it harder and harder to locate the right project when you need it.</p>
<p>As a result, you should be familiar with the functionality offered by courses, described below, and <a href="/books">books</a>.</p>
<p>A course is a very elegant way of managing and organizing your projects. A course has a very simple hierarchy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Course</strong>: the course is the top level and contains modules.</li>
<li><strong>Module</strong>: a module is simply a container for your main project units. If you have 50 project units in your course then you might want to put collections of units into distinct, suitably named modules.</li>
<li><strong>Unit</strong>: a unit is a Codio project that is some unit of teaching. It is entirely up to you how much material is covered by a unit. Approaches include putting about a week, a lesson or a lecture's worth of material into a single unit.</li>
</ul>
<p>A course unit typically takes one of two forms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tutorial</strong>: in this case you would use the <a href="/content/authoring/guides">Codio Guides</a> or <a href="/books/">Codio Books</a> tutorial authoring tools to create your tutorial content. <a href="/content/authoring/3ways">Click here</a> for an overview of the difference.</li>
<li><strong>Assignment</strong>: in this case you create a project unit where everything is set up for the student to tackle a coding assignment or challenge. You can still use guides or books to give instructions, but with assignments, you expect your students will be coding rather than learning.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above two cases are not fixed concepts in Codio but are typical use cases. You can do whatever you like with a project unit.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-courses">Working with courses<a class="headerlink" href="#working-with-courses" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Working with courses often follows the pattern listed below.</p>
<h3 id="setup">Setup<a class="headerlink" href="#setup" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create a new course</strong> and name it.</li>
<li><strong>Create your first module</strong>. You need at least one module to hold your units. A module is an organizational item and a) contains units and b) can be assigned to a class with all its units.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="unit-creation">Unit Creation<a class="headerlink" href="#unit-creation" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Either</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create a new project unit</strong>  this gives you a dedicated Codio box and behaves like a regular Codio project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create a new book unit</strong> which maps to a part of a book. Unlike project units, a book has a single Codio box to work with along with a typically large volume of content.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please <a href="/content/authoring/3ways">click here</a> for details on how to decide whether to use project units or book units</p>
<h3 id="first-version">First version<a class="headerlink" href="#first-version" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>This describes the first time you create a new unit.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Edit your unit</strong>. If your unit is a project unit, clicking the unit will take you into the IDE, as with a Codio project, where you can work on your project.</li>
<li><strong>Publish your unit</strong>. When you think your unit is in good shape, it is ready to publish. A unit is not available to the course until you publish. At this point a snapshot is taken of the unit and it forms a part of the published course.</li>
<li><strong>Assign module to class</strong>. Once you have units published, you may want to <a href="/classes/unitmanagement/assign-module">assign them to a class</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will iterate through the above process as you add more units to your course modules.</p>
<h3 id="updates">Updates<a class="headerlink" href="#updates" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Editing a unit <strong>does not affect published course content or content assigned to classes</strong>. This section describes how you can push your changes out to courses and classes when you are ready.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>More edits to a unit</strong>. After publishing, you may decide to make further changes. These changes do not form a part of the published course unit until you republish, so you can edit without concern for altering published content.</li>
<li><strong>Republish</strong>. Having made more changes, you can publish the unit again in order to make those changes available to the course. However, publishing does not update units previously assigned to a class.</li>
<li><strong>Update class</strong>. If you had assigned a course module to a class and subsequently updated and published a unit within that module, then units within that module are not automatically updated in the class. You need to explicitly do this by going to the class. You should see a red <a href="/classes/unitmanagement/upgradecourse"><strong>Update Course</strong> button</a>. This allows you to selectively update units.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="stack-planning">Stack planning<a class="headerlink" href="#stack-planning" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>The following applies to project units rather than books. Books require less thought as a book only has one box associated with it and the book unit will takes its stack setting from the book.</p>
<p>You should be familiar with the concept of <a href="/project/stacks/stack-overview">a stack</a> before creating CS coursework.</p>
<h3 id="minimize-the-number-of-stacks">Minimize the number of stacks<a class="headerlink" href="#minimize-the-number-of-stacks" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>It is important to think about the <a href="/project/stacks/stack-overview">stack or stacks</a> that your course uses. You should avoid creating a new stack for each unit. There are very few cases where this is needed. If you unnecessarily create new stacks for each unit, you will be be less efficient and waste unnecessary time with stack builds.</p>
<p>You should look to use as few stacks as possible, ideally just one, and use that stack for all units. There are perfectly valid exceptions, but this is the rule.</p>
<h3 id="single-stack-example">Single stack example<a class="headerlink" href="#single-stack-example" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>To illustrate a single stack situation, let's assume you are teaching a course "Programming in Java". You could either use our default Java stack or you start with the Java stack and then add additional tools so it has all the components you require to teach all parts of your course.</p>
<p>Whether you have created your own stack or used a default one, you would then point all your units to that one, same stack.</p>
<p>If, as you create more units in your course, you find you need to install more tools, then you should <a href="/project/stacks/update">update the stack with a new version</a>.</p>
<p>By default, when you choose a stack for your new unit, it will point to the latest version. So if the underlying stack is updated from any location at all, then any unit that uses that stack will automatically be set to use it. Students who are using a unit in a class will also automatically use the latest version when it is updated.</p>
<p>It follows that you should be very careful when pointing to a specific version of a stack, rather than the latest version. If you do this, then you will need to update all units that are not set to use the latest version.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-stack-example">Multiple stack example<a class="headerlink" href="#multiple-stack-example" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Let's say you are teaching a course "Introduction to Programming" and it has 3 modules "Java", "Python" and "Haskell" and each module contains a good number of units. In this case, you could still choose the single stack approach, but you would need to install all three languages and their toolsets and then create a stack from it.</p>
<p>A simpler approach would be to use three separate stacks, one for each language. You set the units for each language to point to the appropriate language stack.</p>
<p>Other than that, the principles described above still apply.</p>
<h3 id="switching-stacks">Switching stacks<a class="headerlink" href="#switching-stacks" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>It is possible to change the stack for a unit. This can be done from either the listing or from within the IDE. However, if this change were to be needed for all units then you would have to repeat this for each unit individually.</p>
<p>It is therefore highly recommended that you start with a stack and stick with it wherever possible.</p>
<h3 id="stacks-not-owned-by-you">Stacks not owned by you<a class="headerlink" href="#stacks-not-owned-by-you" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>If you were to use one of Codio's default stacks then you are not able to update these yourself as you don't have permissions. However, you might want to start off with, say, the Java stack and then install new components.</p>
<p>In this case, you should plan this ahead of time. You would</p>
<ul>
<li>first create the unit from Codio's Java stack</li>
<li>install your components</li>
<li>create a new stack from your unit (<a href="/project/stacks/update#stackide">in the IDE</a> or when you <a href="/courses/units/publish">publish</a>)</li>
<li>make sure your stack is switched to that newly created stack</li>
</ul>
<p>You now own this stack and so you can update whenever you like down the line. When you create new units, you would then choose this new stack.</p>
<h3 id="use-latest-version">Use Latest Version<a class="headerlink" href="#use-latest-version" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>When you assign a stack to a unit, it will be set by default to the <strong>Use Latest Version</strong>. If you view the stack settings from the IDE (<strong>Project-Stack Settings</strong>) or from the 3 blue dots menu, you will see that this is the default.</p>
<p><img alt="Unit stack settings" src="/img/stacksettings.png" /></p>
<p>Understanding what <strong>Use Latest Version</strong> means is important. When you work with a unit as a course author, that unit is actually using a fixed version. It does not automatically switch to the latest version each time a new version of a stack is created. This could be dangerous as switching a stack resets everything outside the workspace folder. If you want to update to the latest version then you need to go to the stack settings dialog and press the save button.</p>
<p>Where <strong>Use Latest Version</strong> is useful is when you assign a course module and its units to a class. In this case, students who have not yet started a unit <strong>will</strong> get the latest version of the stack.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-course">Create a course<a class="headerlink" href="#create-a-course" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>To create a new course, press the <strong>New Course</strong> button in the top right of the screen. You should then complete the fields in the new course screen.</p>
<p><img alt="authtoken" src="/img/course_create.png" /></p>
<h3 id="name-descriptions-image-tags">Name, Descriptions, Image &amp; Tags<a class="headerlink" href="#name-descriptions-image-tags" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>You are required to enter a name for your course. The Short Description is optional but please add something so others can easily identify it.</p>
<p>A <strong>Long Description</strong> is usually a good idea and helps other users understand the scope of your course. This field support markdown.</p>
<p>You can also add tags that identify the technologies used. An image icon is also suggested.</p>
<h3 id="other-settings">Other settings<a class="headerlink" href="#other-settings" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Please refer to the <a href="/courses/manage/course-add/">next page</a> for information on how to control access to courses and modules.</p>
<h2 id="modules">Modules<a class="headerlink" href="#modules" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>A course has to have at least one module. A module contains the individual units that will be assigned to students.</p>
<p>Modules help you organize your units into logical groupings. If your course only contains a few units then you may want only a single module. If, on the other hand, your course has a large number of units, then dividing them between several suitably named modules may make more organizational sense.</p>

<p>To create a new, empty module, press the <strong>Create New Module</strong> button. You can also re-use a module that is located in another course as explained below.</p>
<h3 id="name-descriptions-image-tags_1">Name, Descriptions, Image &amp; Tags<a class="headerlink" href="#name-descriptions-image-tags_1" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>You are required to enter a name for your module. <strong>Short Description</strong> is optional but please add something so others can easily identify it.</p>
<p>A Long Description is usually a good idea and helps other users understand the scope of your course.</p>
<p>You can also add tags that identify the technologies used. An image icon can also be set.</p>
<h3 id="adding-a-module">Adding a Module<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-a-module" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>It is possible to add a module to your course that already exists in another course. Press the <strong>Add Module</strong> button.</p>
<p>The Module browser will open for you to search for the module(s) you wish to add.</p>
<p>You can filter from the available options in the tabs, or search by typing into the search field, whereupon Codio will search within all Module names, descriptions and owner fields.</p>
<p>You can also order the list of modules by name or owner and use the <strong>Filter by Course</strong> drop down to view modules in other courses.</p>

<h3 id="controlling-access">Controlling access<a class="headerlink" href="#controlling-access" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>To control access to a course and its modules, you should understand the difference between public/private and ownership. You can change the access settings by selecting a course or module and then pressing the <strong>Edit</strong> button in the top right.</p>
<p>Both courses and modules need to have their access settings set.</p>
<p><img alt="Edit course" src="/img/courseedit.png" /></p>
<h3 id="ownership">Ownership<a class="headerlink" href="#ownership" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>The ownership field indicates who is able to make administrative changes. In the case of a module, it also indicates who can add, edit and remove project units.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you select <strong>My account</strong>, the default, then only you can make changes.</li>
<li>If you select an organization, by default any teacher within your organization will be able to make changes. If you wish to restrict access to specific teachers, see <a href="/courses/manage/restrict-access/">restrict teacher access</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to prevent access to other teachers within your organization, then you would select <strong>My account</strong> and would also make it private. However, if you were to leave the organization, then no-one would be able to access and manage the course content. As a result, you would change the ownership to the organization in order to ensure that others are able to continue its management.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: if you change the ownership of the course or module to an organization, then it will not longer appear in the <strong>My Courses</strong> list. You will find it in the <strong>Organizations</strong> list instead.</p>
<p><img alt="Course tabs" src="/img/coursestab.png" /></p>
<h3 id="public-and-private">Public and private<a class="headerlink" href="#public-and-private" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>This field indicates who is able to view and access courses and modules. If <strong>public</strong>, then any student or teacher can find and view courses. If <strong>private</strong>, then visibility is determined by the ownership setting:</p>
<ul>
<li>If ownership is is set to <strong>My account</strong>, the default, then you can find the course or module and only you will be able to assign a module to a class.</li>
<li>If ownership is set to an organization, then any teacher or student within your organization will be able to find the course. Any teacher within the organization will be able to assign a course module to a class.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="public-course-and-private-modules-and-vice-versa">Public course and private modules and vice-versa<a class="headerlink" href="#public-course-and-private-modules-and-vice-versa" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>If you have different access settings for the course and its modules, then you should make sure you understand the effects of the ownership and public/private settings.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, you would set your modules and course with the same access settings. If you have a public course and private modules, then although users can find the course, it will appear as if there are no modules present if they are set to be private. If a module is private but organization owned, then they will appear normally to organization members.</p>
<h2 id="restrict-course-access">Restrict course access<a class="headerlink" href="#restrict-course-access" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>By default when a course is created and set to the owned by the organisation, unless the courses menu item is hidden for your students (<a href="/dashboard/create/dash/">click here</a> for more information this), they will be able to view the contents of courses and all teachers in the organisation will have access to the course and associated modules. See <a href="/courses/manage/course-public/">controlling access</a> for more on this.</p>
<p>However, you may want to limit/restrict access to specific courses for teachers and/or students in your organisation.</p>
<p>To do this, select the course and then go the the Course Permissions tab</p>
<p><img alt="Edit course" src="/img/coursepermissions.png" /></p>
<p>By default, the courses are unrestricted but to change this to only allow specific teachers to access the course, select the bottom box and a list of all teachers in the organisation will be shown.</p>
<p>Simply select those teachers who you wish to be able to access the course and the associated modules and units.</p>
<p>Students will not be able to access/view the contents in this course even if courses menu item is not hidden</p>
<h2 id="deleting-courses-and-modules">Deleting courses and modules<a class="headerlink" href="#deleting-courses-and-modules" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>You can delete a course or a module by selecting the item from the listing, then pressing the <strong>Delete</strong> button.</p>
<p>Deleting a course does not delete its modules. Similarly, deleting a module does not delete its units.</p>
<p>If you delete a course or module any modules and units that have already been assigned to a class will remain intact for the lifetime of that class.</p>
<h2 id="adding-units">Adding units<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-units" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>A unit behaves like a Codio project except it will not appear in your projects list. This makes it much easier to find your unit as well as to chronologically arrange the units within each module.</p>
<p>You can mix book units and project units in a course module.</p>
<p>If you have already have a regular project that you want to load into a unit, then the process is described below.</p>
<h3 id="adding-a-new-unit">Adding a new unit<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-a-new-unit" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>You add a new unit by pressing the large blue <strong>+</strong> button. You now need to choose between</p>
<ul>
<li>a project unit</li>
<li>a book unit</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/content/authoring/3ways">Click here</a> if you are not sure about the difference between project units and book units.</p>
<p><a name="projectunit"></a></p>
<h3 id="new-project-unit">New project unit<a class="headerlink" href="#new-project-unit" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>You can create a new unit in the following ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a brand new unit as you would with a normal Codio project.</li>
<li>Import an existing project into the unit. See the image below and read the contents of the <strong>Important</strong> box. A snapshot of the selected project is taken. From that point on you will edit from the unit, not the project.</li>
<li>Import from other sources such as GitHub/BitBucket/Mercurial etc. by selecting the <strong>Import</strong> option.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="UnitStart" src="/img/unitstart.png" /></p>
<p><a name="createbook"></a></p>
<h3 id="new-book-unit">New book unit<a class="headerlink" href="#new-book-unit" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Creating a new book unit involves pointing to the parts of a book that you want to map to your unit. You will seen the following screen.</p>
<p><img alt="Book Unit" src="/img/newbook.png" /></p>
<p>You can now</p>
<ul>
<li>specify the book you want to reference. Browse to the books available to you
<img alt="Book browse" src="/img/selectbook.png" /></li>
<li>select the parts of the book you want to include in this unit</li>
<li>give the unit a name.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Book Mapping" src="/img/bookmapping.png" /></p>
<p>With book units, students can look at any part of the book even when assigned a single book unit. This is ideal for referring back to material covered previously and for general revision and can be set in the class. See <a href="/classes/classmanagement/bookvisibility">Book Visibility</a>] for more information.</p>
<h2 id="publishing">Publishing<a class="headerlink" href="#publishing" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>The publish process is slightly different for books and project units. As you can see from the screenshot below, a book unit can be identified in the unit listing by the book icon that appears next to the unit name.</p>
<h3 id="updating-book-units">Updating book units<a class="headerlink" href="#updating-book-units" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Book units are published from the books area.</p>
<p>Let's say you have already published a book and created a unit from a part of that book. If you then make changes to the book and republish the book, those published changes are not automatically reflected in the course. If you want to update the unit, then need to press the <strong>Update to latest version</strong> button that appears on the right side of the unit.</p>
<p><img alt="Book update" src="/img/bookupdate.png" /></p>
<p>After pressing this, the books changes will be reflected in the unit. If you want these changes to be passed through to a class where the unit was previously added, then please <a href="/classes/unitmanagement/upgradecourse">click here</a> for details.</p>
<h2 id="publishing-project-units">Publishing project units<a class="headerlink" href="#publishing-project-units" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>By default a project unit is not available to others until you explicitly publish it. This ensures that you can make changes, even after publishing, without the published course content being affected.</p>
<p>Publishing the unit takes a snapshot of the underlying project unit and assigns it a new version. Once published, you can make further edits to the unit without changes being visible in the published unit until you publish it again.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the unit from the listing and then press <strong>Publish</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="publishnew" src="/img/publishnew.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>If you have previously published then you will see <strong>Publish new version</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="versions" src="/img/versions.png" /></p>
<h3 id="describe-changes">Describe changes<a class="headerlink" href="#describe-changes" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>You should enter a brief description of the changes you made since the last publish of the unit. You can see the version history on the  <a href="/courses/units/settings/">versions screen</a>.</p>
<h3 id="no-stack-modifications-or-you-switched-stack">No stack modifications or you switched stack<a class="headerlink" href="#no-stack-modifications-or-you-switched-stack" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>If, in your project unit, you have</p>
<ul>
<li>only made changes to the code workspace (the workspace is the contents of the file tree in the IDE or <code>/home/codio/workspace</code>)</li>
<li>or you switched stack but did not make any stack modifications since switching,</li>
</ul>
<p>then you should</p>
<ol>
<li>Enter the changelog text, which is a description of the changes made since the last publish.</li>
<li>Press the <strong>Stack unchanged</strong> button.</li>
<li>Press the <strong>Publish Unit</strong> button when ready.</li>

<p><img alt="versions" src="/img/stack_notmodified.png" /></p>
<h3 id="stack-modifications">Stack modifications<a class="headerlink" href="#stack-modifications" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>If you have made any changes to the project's stack then you should press the <strong>Stack modified</strong> button. Please be aware that changes to the stack can be made indirectly by applications as well as manual file changes. For example, if you modified a database's contents that is not configured to live in the workspace area then these count as stack changes.</p>
<p><img alt="versions" src="/img/stack_modified.png" /></p>
<p>You should now decide whether you want to</p>
<ul>
<li>create a new version of the stack used by the unit</li>
<li>create a brand new stack for this unit.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="stack-modified-new-stack-version">Stack modified : New Stack Version<a class="headerlink" href="#stack-modified-new-stack-version" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Note that if the stack you are using is not owned by you or you don't have permissions to modify the stack, then you will not be able to select this option.</p>
<p>You should enter a description of the stack changes made and then press <strong>Publish Unit</strong>. The new stack version will appear in your stacks listing in the normal way.</p>
<p><img alt="versions" src="/img/stack_newversion.png" /></p>
<h3 id="stack-modified-new-stack">Stack modified: New Stack<a class="headerlink" href="#stack-modified-new-stack" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>If you do not have permissions to create a new stack version or you want to create a new stack that this and potentially other units should use, then select this option.</p>
<p>This will create a new stack with the permissions you specify. To give access only to others within your organization, select <strong>Private</strong> and then select the owner organization from the drop down list below.</p>
<p>It will take a few minutes to prepare the stack, so please be patient. Once it is created, it will be visible your stacks listing.</p>
<p>You should <strong>not</strong> create a new stack for each unit in your course without good reason. You should instead, create a stack and then point all other units that share this stack configuration to point to the new stack.</p>
<p>If you have differing configurations then create one single stack for a given configuration and then point units that use that configuration to the new stack.</p>
<p><img alt="versions" src="/img/stack_newstack.png" /></p>
<h3 id="important-switching-a-units-stack">IMPORTANT: Switching a unit's stack<a class="headerlink" href="#important-switching-a-units-stack" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Let's say you have one or more units and you decide to change the stack that they point to. You can switch the stack either from within the IDE (<strong>Project-&gt;Stack settings</strong>) or from the units listing (press the 3 blue dots and select <strong>Change stack</strong>).</p>
<p>Once this has been done, you need to publish your unit again to reflect this change. Having switched stack, you should select <strong>Stack not modified</strong> and then press <strong>Publish Unit</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want to edit book unit content, then you edit the book from the books listing, not the unit listing. You would then republish the book after which you will see <strong>Update to latest version</strong> in the unit listing.</p>
<p><img alt="Book update" src="/img/bookupdate.png" /></p>
<p>If you have added new content then you can also remap the unit to the book as described on the <a href="/courses/units/unit-add#createbook">adding a unit</a> page.</p>
<h3 id="editing-a-project-unit">Editing a project unit<a class="headerlink" href="#editing-a-project-unit" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Editing a project unit is always done from the unit listing.  Select the unit to open in the IDE.</p>
<p>If there is a later version of the unit that has been published, you will see the following screen and elect to open either the latest published version or the last version you edited.</p>
<p><img alt="publishedversion" src="/img/publishedversion.png" /></p>
<h2 id="ordering-units">Ordering units<a class="headerlink" href="#ordering-units" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>

<h3 id="edit-settings">Edit settings<a class="headerlink" href="#edit-settings" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>For project units, select <strong>Edit settings</strong> to change the unit title, description and icon.</p>
<p>For book units, you can also remap the unit to the book contents.</p>
<h3 id="versions">Versions<a class="headerlink" href="#versions" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>This allows you to view the version history. You can see</p>
<ul>
<li>date/time when the unit was published,</li>
<li>name of the person who published the unit,</li>
<li>the name and version of the stack assigned to the unit.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="versions" src="/img/versiondetails.png" /></p>
<h3 id="change-stack">Change stack<a class="headerlink" href="#change-stack" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>This option is only available for project units. It allows you to switch the stack used by a unit.</p>
<p>If a stack is set to <strong>Use latest version</strong> then</p>
<ul>
<li>when a unit has been assigned to a class, any student who has not yet started the unit will use the latest version of the stack.</li>
<li>the unit itself will remain on whatever stack version was last assigned. If you want to change it to the latest created stack version then you should click the <strong>Save Changes</strong> button to update it.</li>

<ul>
<li>Select <strong>Convert content to a project</strong> to delete the unit and its content entirely.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Delete content</strong> to delete the unit and save the unit contents to your projects list.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="update-course-in-class">Update course in class<a class="headerlink" href="#update-course-in-class" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>If you publish new course unit content, then this is not automatically applied to classes. It has to be explicitly pulled into the class as <a href="/classes/unitmanagement/upgradecourse">described here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="collaborating-on-project-units">Collaborating on project units<a class="headerlink" href="#collaborating-on-project-units" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>The ability for other to collaborate on course units is controlled from the module settings. Please note that the module permissions override the course permissions, so if a course is public and a module is private, then the units will be private.</p>
<p><img alt="Module Edit" src="/img/moduleedit.png" /></p>
<p>The rules for other users to edit a project unit in a course are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Private</strong> - only you can edit the project unit.</li>
<li><strong>Private but organization is the owner</strong> - any teacher in your organization can edit.</li>
<li><strong>Public</strong> - only you can edit.</li>
<li><strong>Public but organization is the owner</strong> - any teacher in your organization can edit.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ability to create public courses/modules can be enabled for the organization. See <a href="/dashboard/create/public_private">Public/Private setttings</a> for more information.</p>
<p><img alt="authtoken" src="/img/manage_organization/public_private.png" /></p>
<p>If you want 2 or more people to collaborate on a project unit, you need to understand how Codio manages this process.</p>
<p>The key thing you need to realize is that unless you are familiar with Git, <strong>only one user should make changes at a time</strong>. If User A and User B want to collaborate, then they need to inform each other when they are working on the content. If they fail to do so, then one person will have to surrender their changes later on.</p>
<p>Let's say User A has authored a unit and has finished work. At this point, User A must publish the unit for others to be able to carry on from this point.</p>
<p>User B now makes changes to the unit. When done, User B should inform User A that the changes are complete and published. At this point, when User A opens the unit for editing, a dialog will appear showing that User B has published new changes.</p>
<p><img alt="publishedversion" src="/img/publishedversion.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="Book update" src="/img/bookupdate.png" /></p>
<p>User A now wants User B to be able to collaborate. User A should inform User B that the unit is ready to edit. When User B accesses the unit, Codio will take a <strong>snapshot</strong> of the published unit and User B can start work on it. In other words, User B is <strong>not</strong> editing User A's unit, User B has a clone.</p>
<p>User B now makes changes to the unit. When done, User B should publish the changes in the same way that User A did. User B then informs User A that the changes are complete and published. At this point, when User A opens the unit for editing, a dialog will appear showing that User B has published new changes. A new snapshot is then taken and User A (or any other user for that matter) can editing.</p>
<p>The important point in this process is that any user who has made changes and wants other to see those changes should publish first.</p></div>
