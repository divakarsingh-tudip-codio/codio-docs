<p>The grouping intervals are</p>
<ul>
<li>Sep-Dec - Autumn</li>
<li>Jan-May - Spring</li>
<li>Jun-Aug - Summer</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ordering-courses-within-their-groups">Ordering courses within their groups<a class="headerlink" href="#ordering-courses-within-their-groups" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>

<p>If you have a large number of courses, you can also search by name. Select the <strong>Name</strong> option and simply start typing, whereupon Codio will search within all course names and filter your list accordingly.
<img alt="Name" src="../../img/manage_classes/nameclass.png" /></p>
<h3 id="archiving-courses">Archiving Courses<a class="headerlink" href="#archiving-courses" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>To help manage the number of courses visible to teachers  they can be archived so they no longer show on the active screen for teachers. Go to the 3 blue dot menu and select 'Archive Course'. 
Archiving a course does not effect students and they will be able to continue working on assignments but just removes them from the active tab.  They are not deleted and can be unarchived at any time in the future if they are required either by clicking on the course in the archived tab or from the 3 blue dot menu and selecting 'Unarchive Course'</p>
<h2 id="adding-teachers-to-a-course">Adding teachers to a course<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-teachers-to-a-course" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>

<p>You can add students to your organization and your course easily by giving each student a unique two-word phrase called a token or by giving them in Course Invitation URL.  A student will enter the token and will automatically be added to the your organization and the correct course as they complete the process to create a Codio account.  To do this follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From the <strong>Courses</strong> area, click on your course to open it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Students</strong> tab, top centre of your screen.

</li>
<li>
<p>You can then send the 2 word token to your students, send them the Invite URL to join the course or you can add the Test students to your course. We recommend you use the <strong>Invite URL</strong> to avoid students going through the process to create a new organisation where they may click on the <strong>Free Trial</strong> button in error. There maybe a delay in us being able to get back to them to advise them of the correct steps to take but if you use the Invite URL, they should be able to get started a lot quicker.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Add Students" src="../../img/manage_classes/addstudents.png" /></p>

<li>
<p>If using the token then ask them to go to <a href="https://codio.com/p/join-class">https://codio.com/p/join-class</a> or select the <strong>Join Course</strong> button on our main website. They should enter the token when requested and proceed to register for a Codio account.</p>

<p>You should see a <strong>Grading Templates</strong> tab item. There will be fewer tabs visible if you are not an organization owner.</p>
<p><img alt="rubric setup" src="../../img/class_administration/grading/templates.png" /></p>
<p>Click the <strong>New</strong> button in the to right to create a new template. You should then add rows and columns.</p>
<p><strong>Rows</strong> : a row addresses a single assessment criterion. Each row has a weighting % value that you should supply. All rows must add up to 100%.
<strong>Columns</strong> : each column contains a score that you can freely assign. Typically, you would have a 0 value in the first column that corresponds to a complete failure to address the criterion. The remaining columns contain a range of values that you choose with the right most column being the score for fully meeting the assessment criterion. Please read the following paragraph before choosing column values.</p>
<h3 id="calculation-of-scores">Calculation of scores<a class="headerlink" href="#calculation-of-scores" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>When you are grading student code, the grading rubric will appear and is clickable. Points are awarded according to where you click. Codio will then weight the scores according to the weightings that were provided for each row.</p>
<p>A final score is calculated based on your selections and is re-based to the maximum column value. You should be aware of this when choosing your column values. If you wanted your scores to calculate directly to percentages then you should choose a maximum value of 100 with other column values distributed between 0 and 100.</p>

<h2 id="gigaboxes">Gigaboxes<a class="headerlink" href="#gigaboxes" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>A Gigabox is a box that has a higher memory allocation than the standard Codio boxes. The default memory allocation is 400MB, which is fine for most applications.</p>
<p>If you need your students to have more memory then we offer 1GB, 2GB, 8GB,16GB and GPU (for GPU-accelerated instances) boxes. These need to be purchased separately and you can add any number of either box size to your organization. You will need to specify the Gigabox size and then each student accessing the assignment will have a Gigabox for that assignment.</p>
<p>You can set the required Gigabox in your project or assignment in the course module and this setting will be automatically applied to the assignments as you add the module into a course</p>
<p>You should be aware that if you do not have enough Gigaboxes in your organization then they will be allocated on a first come, first served basis. Students who access the assignment after your Gigabox limit has been reached will see a warning.</p>
<p>An organization owner can see the status of the Gigabox count in the organization settings screen.</p>
<h2 id="assign-a-project-to-the-course">Assign a project to the course<a class="headerlink" href="#assign-a-project-to-the-course" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>In Codio, a teaching assignment is a project that has been assigned to a course. The scope of an assignment is entirely up to you but it could be a project assignment that a course works on. It could also be some tutorial content built using Guides. We generally recommend that it relates reasonably closely to a lesson or two. But if you prefer and it suits your structure better then you can assign as much or as little content to a Unit as you like.</p>
<p>There are two ways you can assign an assessment to a course.</p>
<h3 id="assign-a-project">Assign a project<a class="headerlink" href="#assign-a-project" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>The simplest and quickest thing you can do is to assign one of your projects to a course. Once assigned, we refer to it as an assessment but the assessment's source is simply a project.</p>
<ul>
<li>With the course selected, click on the Assessment tab at the top of the page. The list will be empty at this point.</li>
<li>Now click the <strong>+</strong> button in the top left.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Empty Module</strong> and create a new module.</li>
<li>When created click <strong>Add Assignment</strong> and then select <strong>Project Based</strong></li>
<li>From here you can either start creating a new project or import projects in.</li>
<li>To import an existing project see: </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="../../img/import.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Then select <strong>Fork Project</strong> and your project will show. If you have other projects in your <strong>My Projects</strong> area you can browse to select one of them.</li>
<li>At this point you can set the name of the assignment (by default it will be the name of your project with 'fork' appended) and add a description if you wish.</li>
<li>When ready, click the <strong>Create</strong> button and the assignment will be added to the course module in draft mode.</li>
<li>To create a new assignment, select your starting point (the stack you wish to start from) and you can create your assignment. For more information on authoring your content, strategies etc, see <a href="../../courses/coursemanagement">Course Management</a></li>
<li>For the assignments to be visible to your students, you need to <strong>Publish</strong> the assignment.</li>
<li>Any changes you make in future to assigments will not be visible to students until you publish again</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="../../img/publish.png" /></p>
<p>At this point, we take a snapshot of your source project, ready for the students to clone when they start the assignment. Any changes you make to the source project will not be reflected automatically in the student assignment.</p>
<p>Once assigned to the course, each student will be able to access the assignment from their dashboard. Go to the <strong>Students</strong> tab and login as one of the test students. Make sure you have the correct course and module selected form the dropdowns. You will now see the assignment in the list. If you don't, make sure the module dropdown has the correct module name selected.  You can then switch back to your teacher account.</p>
<h3 id="assign-resource-modules-to-the-course">Assign resource modules to the course<a class="headerlink" href="#assign-resource-modules-to-the-course" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>

Where you are using content in multiple courses and changes are made to that content, these changes will be detected and you can upgrade the content of the other courses to the latest version from the <strong>Update Course</strong> button. The code workspace, other than the guides folder, is never updated as this can invalidate work for students who have already started the assignment.</p>
<p><img alt="Update Course" src="../../img/class_administration/upgradecourse.png" /></p>
<p>Updates may be new assignments added to the course, a new version of the stack, updates for assessments in a guide or book, changes to the general guide content or a change in the order of assignments in the course.</p>
<p>Most assessment changes can be safely upgraded but if you have altered the structure of a question (for example multiple choice changed from single response to multiple response) then student response data can be invalidated.</p>
<p><img alt="Upgrade Stack" src="../../img/class_administration/upgradecoursedialog.png" /></p>
<p>Any changes to guides content can be applied. You should be careful about making major structural changes as students who have already started the assignment could be confused. The code workspace folder will not be impacted, so any student work in this folder will not be impacted.</p>

<p>On the module assignment screen you can manage the following settings</p>
<p><img alt="assignmentscreen" src="../../img/class_administration/modulesettings.png" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Change the name of the assigment</li>
<li>See if an assignment is in DRAFT mode, and therefore not visible to students in the course</li>
<li>Publish the assignment. This is required before students will be able to see the assignment and also if you have need to update the assignment those changes will not be visible to students until it is published again</li>
<li>View the version history of the assigment publications, This allows you to view the version history. You can see<ul>
<li>date/time when the assignment was published,</li>
<li>name of the person who published the assignment,</li>
<li>the name and version of the stack assigned to the assignment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="versions" src="../../img/versiondetails.png" />
1. View (and change) the stack settings for the assignment. This option is only available for project assignments. It allows you to switch the stack used by a assignment. If a stack is set to <strong>Use latest version</strong> then
    - when a assignment has been assigned to a course, any student who has not yet started the assignment will use the latest version of the stack.
    - the assignment itself will remain on whatever stack version was last assigned. If you want to change it to the latest created stack version then you should click the <strong>Save Changes</strong> button to update it.
1. Delete the individual assignment from the module. You are required to enter a confirmation code to proceed and you can then do one of the following
    - Select <strong>Convert content to a project</strong> to delete the assignment and save the assignment contents to your projects list.
    - Select <strong>Delete content</strong> to delete the assignment and its content entirely.
1. Delete the entire module. You are required to enter a confirmation code to proceed
1. Reorder the modules in the course. </p>
<p>You can also change the order of the assignments within a module by dragging an assignment into its desired position in the list.</p>
<p>To the top right of the list item is a pencil icon. </p>

<h4 id="pinunpin-units">Pin/unpin units<a class="headerlink" href="#pinunpin-units" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>This allows you to <a href="../../classes/unitmanagement/settings-info/pin">pin or unpin an assignment</a>. Pinning an assignment ensures that the assignment is shown in a large box at the top of the student dashboard. You would typically pin an assignment if this is the assignment you are currently teaching. When you have finished teaching it, you would unpin it. You should not have more than four assignments pinned.</p>
<h4 id="disableenable-assignment">Disable/enable assignment<a class="headerlink" href="#disableenable-assignment" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>You can enable or disable assignments that have been assigned to a course. This is useful when your students are working in controlled assessment conditions and you only want them to have access to their work within a prescribed timeframe.
For book based assignments, you should be aware that if another assignment gives access to the book then students can access the book. You have the ability to <a href="../../classes/unitmanagement/settings-info/disable/">disable access to content outside the current assignment</a> but if the student is able to access the terminal window or see the file tree then access to areas that you intend to be disabled cannot be guaranteed. For project assignments and normal projects, preventing access can be guaranteed.</p>
<h4 id="visibility-on-completed">Visibility on completed<a class="headerlink" href="#visibility-on-completed" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>You can specify the students ability to access the assignment when completed. <strong>Not available for book based assignments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>'None' will allow students to continue to access and work in code files, any assessments in the assignment can be seen but not changed,</li>
<li>'Read-Only' will allow students to access their assignment but not make any changes.</li>
<li>'No Access' will not allow the students to access their assignment.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="visibility-on-disabled">Visibility on disabled<a class="headerlink" href="#visibility-on-disabled" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>You can specify the students ability to access the assignment when disabled.  <strong>Not available for book based assignments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>'Read-Only' will allow students to access their assignment but not make any changes.</li>
<li>'No Access' will not allow the students to access their assignment.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="unit-duration">Unit duration<a class="headerlink" href="#unit-duration" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>You can specify a start and a stop date and time for an assignment. The assignment will be disabled prior to the start date at which point it becomes available to students in their dashboard.</p>
<p>Once the stop date and time is reached you can set the assignment to be marked as complete and/or disabled. If you elect to disable access, then depending on your <a href="../../courses/classes/#disableenable-assignment">disabled assignment settings</a> students will either be refused all access or can have read-only access to the assignment.</p>
<p>Please note, that selecting mark as complete will not stop students who have not started the assignment from being able to access the assignment after the stop date/time has been reached. If you wish to manage this, look at using the disable assignment and mark as complete option.</p>
<p>For book based assignments, you should read the caveats mentioned in the <strong>Disable/enable assignment</strong> section above.</p>
<p><img alt="authtoken" src="../../img/manage_classes/unitduration.png" /></p>

<h4 id="penalties">Penalties<a class="headerlink" href="#penalties" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>If applying penalties for late submission it is recommended that you set the end date/time for the assignment to the last date/time of your penalties.
You can set the penalty date/time after the assignment end date/time but for students to then be able to work you will need to change the individual students assignment status from <a href="../../classes/unitmanagement/settings-info/complete-unit/">Completed</a> and also adjust the <a href="../../classes/unitmanagement/settings-info/penalties/">deadline</a> for each of them.</p>
<p><strong>Time Zones</strong>
The time zone is taken automatically from your browser, so please check your time settings are correct.</p>
<h5 id="set-assignment-penalties">Set assignment penalties<a class="headerlink" href="#set-assignment-penalties" title="Permanent link"></a></h5>
<p>You can specify penalties in the event that students do not complete the assignment within agreed timescales. Incremental penalties can be applied if required.</p>
<p><img alt="penalties" src="../../img/penalties.png" /></p>
<p>Each row in the table will contain the following fields :</p>
<ul>
<li>Number (auto-incremental)</li>
<li>Date</li>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Penalty % (The % of the total score for the assignment to be deducted as a penalty)</li>
<li>Message (If the message field is not specified, then a default message will be generated - see below)</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="default-messages">Default Messages:<a class="headerlink" href="#default-messages" title="Permanent link"></a></h5>
<p>1: If a student opens a project after deadline or the student is working in the assignment when deadline is reached</p>
<p><code>Deadline X (the table row number) has been reached. This deadline carries a penalty of Y%. You can review your answers with no penalty. However, if you decide to change any answers by pressing the Modify button beneath a question, a Y% penalty deduction will be applied to your overall results. Once a modify button has been pressed once, the penalty deduction will be applied and you will be free to modify as many questions as you like with no additional penalty</code></p>
<p>2: If a student presses a Modify button past a deadline</p>
<p><code>Deadline X (the table row number) has been reached. This deadline carries a penalty of Y%. If you proceed, a Y% penalty deduction will be applied to your overall results. You will then be able to modify as many questions as you like with no additional penalty</code></p>
<p>3: Final deadline (assignment end date)</p>
<p>Once the final deadline hits (if one is set), the assignment will be forced to read-only and then following message will be displayed to the student :</p>
<p><code>You have exceeded the final deadline. You are no longer able to make changes to your answers. You are free to review your answers.</code></p>

<p><strong>Penalty indicator:</strong> If a penalty was applied then the grade field will have a light red background. This should be the case even if no grade has been calculated yet. Hover above the field to see the penalty details (#, date/time, penalty %).
<img alt="dashboard penalty" src="../../img/penaltydashboard.png" />
<strong>Final grade field:</strong> this field will show the final graded score less any penalty deduction. If the field is overwritten by the teacher/instructor, then the penalty deduction will not be applied.</p>

<p>Select the assignment from the course assignments list and click on the 3 blue vertical dots and select 'Adjust deadline'</p>
<p><img alt="penalties" src="../../img/penaltydeadline.png" /></p>
<p>You can then adjust the deadline forward by as many days as you require</p>
<p><img alt="penalties" src="../../img/deadlineadjust.png" /></p>
<p>When applied, the adjustment will then show next to the grade field in the teacher/instructors dashboard. The deadline in the image below was adjusted by 4 days</p>

<h4 id="autograde-on-assignment-complete">Autograde on assignment complete<a class="headerlink" href="#autograde-on-assignment-complete" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>This option provides two ways of autograding assignment scores for each student. The grading field is populated by a script authored by the project author without the need to manually populate it. The autograding script is triggered once an assignment is marked as complete.</p>
<p>A assignment is marked as complete in any of the following ways</p>
<ol>
<li>Students mark the assignment as complete from their dashboard.</li>
<li>The teacher can also mark the assignment as complete for a student from the Course dashboard with the assignment selected.</li>
<li>The teacher can mark all assignments as complete for all students by pressing the <strong>Actions</strong> button. This button appears on the assignment screen.</li>
<li>If you are using the <strong>Assignment Duration</strong> feature, all student assignments are marked as complete as soon as the assignment duration expiry date and time is reached.</li>
</ol>
<p>The two autograding options can be found in the assignment settings.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the auto-graded assessments within the assignment to auto-populate the grading field with the aggregate % score from all assessments.</li>
<li>Run a script to generate the grading either as soon as the student (or teacher) marks the assignment as complete in their dashboard or when the <a href="../../classes/unitmanagement/settings-info/unit-duration/">assignment duration</a> expires.</li>
</ol>
<p>The two options can be found in the <strong>AUTOGRADE METHOD</strong> drop-down list.</p>
<p><a name="transfer"></a></p>
<h4 id="transferring-authored-content-assessment-total">Transferring authored content assessment total<a class="headerlink" href="#transferring-authored-content-assessment-total" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>If you have created auto-graded assessments within your authored content, Codio aggregates all scores so you can see them in the Courses dashboard. You will see that there is a total percentage calculated. This percentage value is transferred into the grading field. If you are using <a href="../../classes/lti">LMS integration</a> then this grading field is then transferred into your LMS gradebook once you <a href="../../classes/monitor/grading">release the grades</a>.</p>
<p><a name="script"></a></p>
<h4 id="running-a-custom-script">Running a custom script<a class="headerlink" href="#running-a-custom-script" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>A more advanced way of populating the grading field is to write your own custom script that evaluates the student code. This script can then transfer the grading value into the grading field.</p>
<p>If you are using an LMS platform with Codio then be sure to write a percentage value into this field to maintain compatibility with LMS gradebooks.</p>
<p><img alt="authtoken" src="../../img/grading-secure.png" /></p>
<p><a name="securescripts"></a></p>
<h4 id="secure-scripts">Secure scripts<a class="headerlink" href="#secure-scripts" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>If you want your scripts to run securely such that the student has no way of either viewing the script or viewing other files that might contain secure data then you should place those scripts and files in the <code>.guides/secure</code> folder. Codio ensures that only the original project author is able to access this folder but when it is assigned to Students as an assignment, it is not accessible in any way and the script runs in an ephemeral container isolated from the students assignment.</p>
<h4 id="timeout">Timeout<a class="headerlink" href="#timeout" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>Your script must execute within 3 minutes or a timeout error will occur.</p>
<h4 id="accessing-authored-content-assessment-results">Accessing authored content assessment results<a class="headerlink" href="#accessing-authored-content-assessment-results" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>You are able to get scores attained by students in authored content based autograded assessments. This data is in JSON format and can be accessed from the <code>CODIO_AUTOGRADE_ENV</code> environment variable. Below is an example.</p>
<pre><code>{
  &quot;assessments&quot;: {
    &quot;stats&quot;: {
      &quot;total&quot;: 2,
      &quot;answered&quot;: 2,
      &quot;correct&quot;: 2,
      &quot;totalPoints&quot;: 12,
      &quot;points&quot;: 8
    },
    &quot;info&quot;: [{
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Test 1&quot;,
      &quot;points&quot;: 5,
      &quot;answer&quot;: {
        &quot;correct&quot;: true,
        &quot;points&quot;: 5
      }
    }, {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Test 2&quot;,
      &quot;points&quot;: 7,
      &quot;answer&quot;: {
        &quot;correct&quot;: true,
        &quot;points&quot;: 3
      }
    }]
  },
  &quot;completedDate&quot;: &quot;2017-02-07T09:47:54.471Z&quot;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can get both summary data and data for each assessment individually.</p>
<p><a name="regrading"></a></p>
<h4 id="regrading-for-an-individual-student">Regrading for an individual student<a class="headerlink" href="#regrading-for-an-individual-student" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>If students set their work to 'complete' such that an autograde step is triggered then you can regrade the work by resetting the complete switch and then setting it again, which re-triggers the autograding.</p>
<h4 id="regrading-all-students">Regrading all students<a class="headerlink" href="#regrading-all-students" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>From the <strong>Actions</strong> area of the assignment, you can regrade all students that have already been auto-graded by pressing the <strong>Regrade All</strong> button. This is useful if you have found a bug in your grading script. If you follow (or use) the code sample shown at the bottom of this page you can see how the original student submission date is handled.</p>
<h4 id="testing-and-debugging-your-grading-scripts">Testing and debugging your grading scripts<a class="headerlink" href="#testing-and-debugging-your-grading-scripts" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: please read this section carefully.</p>
<p>We provide a way of testing autograding scripts when authoring your project. This is described below. You should make use of this before publishing your project to a course.</p>
<p>You should be aware that once the assignment has been published to the course, any changes made to the assignment's source project are not automatically reflected in the published assignment. As a result, if you include your main grading logic within the project itself and if that script has bugs, you will not be able to fix the bugs without deleting the assignment, fixing the bug and finally republishing the assignment. All student data will be lost as a result. However, if all your scripts are stored in <code>.guides/secure</code> folder, you can update and test them and you can then <a href="../../classes/unitmanagement/settings-info/updateunit/">Update assignment</a></p>
<p>Another strategy is to use a simple bootstrap launcher that loads and executes the script from a remote location that you can edit and debug independently of the Codio box.</p>
<p>The following example bash script shows a Python script that is located as a Gist on GitHub. This script might be called <code>.guides/secure/launcher.sh</code>.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
URL=&quot;https://gist.githubusercontent.com/MaximKraev/11cd4e43b0c43f79d9478efbe21ba1b9/raw/validate.py&quot;
curl -fsSL $URL | python - $@
</code></pre>

<p>It is important that it is located in the <code>.guides/secure</code> folder. You then specify the full filepath <code>.guides/secure/launcher.sh</code> in the <strong>Set custom script path</strong> field in the assignment settings.</p>
<p>You are now free to debug the Python script and fix any bugs that you may have noticed once students have started work on the assignment.</p>
<h4 id="testing-your-script-in-the-ide">Testing your script in the IDE<a class="headerlink" href="#testing-your-script-in-the-ide" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>We provide the ability to test your autograding script from the <strong>Education -&gt; Test Autograde Script</strong> menu.</p>
<p>This option lets you specify the location to your autograding script and run it against the current project contents. It also lets you simulate scores attained by any autograded assessments located within the Codio Guide.</p>
<p><img alt="authtoken" src="../../img/autograde-test.png" /></p>
<p>You should be aware of the following points.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you press the <strong>Test Script</strong> button</li>
<li>all output to <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> are displayed within the dialog</li>
<li>the grade as returned by your test script is at the bottom of the output section</li>
<li><code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> output is not available when running for real (not in this test mode) as the autograding script runs invisibly when the assignment is marked as complete. As such, you should generate output for testing and debugging purposes only.</li>
<li>If you want your script to provide any feedback to the student, then you should output it to a file that the student can access when opening the project at a later date. In this case you will need to allow read-only access to the project from the assignment settings after being marked as complete.</li>
<li>Your script must execute within 3 minutes to avoid a timeout error.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Guide has autograded assessments then the test takes its data from the fields shown in the dialog. All of your assessment settings are accessed as described above under <strong>Accessing Guide assessment results</strong>.</p>
